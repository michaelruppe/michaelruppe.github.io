  The image shown on the left is the original, unedited source image.
  Here, the data that makes up the text "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien is hidden within the image - specifically, distributed across the least-significant bits of each pixel.
  The image shown on the right has this text encoded into it. The decoded text is shown below. The point here is that the images are (to the eye) indistinguishable, yet an enormous amount of information may be concealed.
  Raw text for The Hobbit is from <a href="https://archive.org/stream/TheHobbitByJRRTolkienEBOOK/The%20Hobbit%20byJ%20%20RR%20Tolkien%20EBOOK_djvu.txt">archive.org</a><br>
